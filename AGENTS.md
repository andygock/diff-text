When editing source code, never remove existing comments unless the edit makes them obsolete. Preserve user-added comments to maintain code documentation and context.

Always use `pnpm` commands for installing and managing JavaScript packages. Never use `npm` or `yarn` directly.

Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` as part of your code editing process. Iterate to fix any issues found.
